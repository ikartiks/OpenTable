# Demo app
Hi ! Kartik again. here are a a few things I would like you to know before reviewing the project.

I have done all things required for the scope of this project.

#### Tradeoffs
I have only added unit tests for one class TimeUtils.kt, because it holds the logic of managing time which is core to the application. Please let me know if you need more tests (unit or UI), I am happy to add them . I am hoping you would also appreciate how I am mocking ResProvider for anythign related to context in a unit test. I know it is a bit controversial but I am open to discussions :smile:


## ! [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)
Just clone the repo from github into android studio and you should be good to go


#### Other
I have also recently worked on Jetpack Compose and could have done this project using it. For now i just thought its better to do things the MVVM way as there are limitations to Compose.
